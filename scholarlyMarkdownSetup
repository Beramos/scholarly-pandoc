After a lot of problems and trying different blog post i finally stumbled upon the scholdoc 

http://scholdoc.scholarlymarkdown.com/

First install pandoc and pandoc-citeproc for citations

the problem with scoldoc is that is not yet fully functional with docx

This implementation of scholarly markdown is the first one I got to work.

You need a working tex installation, i propose texlive

When building with tex it is quite possible that you get an error that lmodern.sty is not found.

Install the full texlive package:
sudo apt-get install texlive-full

copy templates to ~/.pandoc/templates
copy csl to ~/.pandoc/csl
copy css to ~/.pandoc/css

some additional templating dependencies are included in the folder, you can either copy them every document of put em in a central location where tex can find it, in the folder texmf:

Templates: https://github.com/kjhealy/pandoc-templates


----- Changex ----
removed VC package
removed minionPro font (proprietary font) still looking for a good font. Libertine is on my radar

----- Usage -------
make to run
make clean to clean

I additionally use cross-ref for referenceing and numbering equations 

[this package](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref/releases/tag/v0.3.2.0)

[tutorial here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-crossref-0.2.2.1)

just copy the filter in you're folder
