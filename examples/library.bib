abstract = {The forces on a small rigid sphere in a nonuniform flow are considered from first prinicples in order to resolve the errors in Tchens equation and the subsequent modified versions that have since appeared. Forces from the undisturbed flow and the disturbance flow created by the presence of the sphere are treated separately. Proper account is taken of the effect of spatial variations of the undisturbed flow on both forces. In particular the appropriate Faxen correction for unsteady Stokes flow is derived and included as part of the consistent approximation for the equation of motion.},
